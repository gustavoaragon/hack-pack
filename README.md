# The Blockstrap Hack-Pack

### Hackathon Get Started Guide

When participating in the organization of the [DBS Bank Blockchain Hack](http://blockstrap.com/en/blog/dbs-blockchain-hack-de-brief/) in Singapore we made several observatons and contributions that others may find useful when organizing their own blockchain-based hackathons. 

This repo is an intended starting point for any blockchain developer who is about to embark on their own hack. It features a getting started guide, dcoumentation from Blockstrap.com, and 5 open source example applications that can be ripped and modified.

Please not that this Hack-Pack is a work in progress and will continue to be updated in the future as Blockstrap powers more hackathons around the globe.

Our three focus points for creating this hack-pack have been the following categories...

```
-- Preparation
-- Education
-- Activation
```

#### 1) Preparation

#### 3) Activation

If you're helping organize the event, you really need to 'work the floor' and engage with developers throughout. As organizers of any hack, the quality of ideas produced is directly linked to the quality of support hackers receive. 

We reccomend checking-in with each team at least every two to three hours.

Blockstrap also provides low-level anonymous usage of it's API which is ideal for getting developers started quickly. More details can be found at http://blockstrap.com/en/API
