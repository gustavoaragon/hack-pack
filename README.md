# The Blockstrap Hack-Pack

### Hackathon Starting Guide

When participating in the organization of the [DSB Blockchain Hackathon](http://blockstrap.com/en/blog/dbs-blockchain-hack-de-brief/) in Singapore, we made several observatons and contributions that others may find useful when organizing blockchain-based hackathons. We will organize these thoughts within one the following categories...

```
-- Preparation
-- Education
-- Activation
```

We conducted two 5 hour workshops during the week leading upto the hackathon.

We covered the following topics:

You then need to engage throughout the entire event. 

Check-in with each team every two to three hours.
